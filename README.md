# RAG-Chatbot
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot that leverages LangChain, Python, MySQL Database, FastAPI, Streamlit, Redis, and OpenAI LLM for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The chatbot is designed to retrieve relevant information from a companyâ€™s database and provide context-aware responses using OpenAI's language models.

## Tech Stack
* Python: The main programming language used for developing the chatbot.
* LangChain: For building the RAG pipeline and integrating LLMs with retrieval systems.
* MySQL: The database used to store and manage company data.
* FastAPI: For building the backend API to interact with the chatbot.
* Streamlit: For creating the front-end UI to interact with the chatbot.
* Redis: Used to store and manage conversation history to improve user experience.
* OpenAI API: For NLP and generating text using OpenAI's language models (LLM).
